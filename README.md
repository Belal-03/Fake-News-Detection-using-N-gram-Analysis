# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using N-gram Analysis (Arabic Dataset)

This project explores and analyzes an Arabic fake news dataset using **N-gram techniques** to identify patterns that distinguish fake news from real news content.

---

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- **AraFacts Dataset**: A labeled dataset containing Arabic news articles categorized as fake or real.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Tasks & Deliverables

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Load and explore the dataset  
- Clean the text by removing:
  - Punctuation  
  - Diacritics  
  - Stop words  
- Tokenize the Arabic text  
- Normalize words to handle variants (if applicable)  

### 2. N-gram Feature Engineering

- Generate the following n-grams from the cleaned data:  
  - **Unigrams** (1-word phrases)  
  - **Bigrams** (2-word phrases)  
  - **Trigrams** (3-word phrases)  
- Utilize NLP libraries such as **NLTK** or other Arabic NLP tools for tokenization and n-gram generation  

### 3. Data Visualization

- Plot the most frequent unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams separately for **fake** and **real** news categories  
- Use **word clouds** or other visualization techniques to highlight patterns  

### 4. Report Writing

Prepare a detailed PDF report covering:  
- **Introduction**: Purpose and dataset description  
- **Methodology**: Preprocessing and n-gram generation steps  
- **Visualizations**: Word clouds and other graphics used  
- **Patterns & Insights**: Observations distinguishing fake from real news  
- **Challenges & Limitations**: Any issues encountered during preprocessing or analysis  
- **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential applications
